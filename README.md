# What is life simulation?
- Life simulation is a small sandbox for creating sustainable envinroments for eagles, bears, lizards and ants.
- By starting with a set of animals, see a species die off or overpopulate to the point animals further down the food chain suffer.
- Communal animals can look out for eachother, storing extra food and water inside of shelters for animals of the same species who are struggling.
- Throughout their lifecycle, once old enough, require a shelter to reproduce. An animal of the other gender needs to be in the shelter at the same time. Traits are passed down through this proccess, traits are selected from the parents and will be randomly modified to encourage "mutation". As the simulation progresses animal stats should improve.
- Animals who find a shelter will remember the location, and head towards it whe they have excess food / water or are staving / dehydrating. Over time, animals will forget this location, their memory will be refreshed when seeing the shelter once more.
