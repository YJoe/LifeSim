# What is life simulation?
- Life simulation is a small sandbox for creating sustainable environments for eagles, bears, lizards and ants.
- By starting with a set of animals, see a species die off or overpopulate to the point animals further down the food chain suffer.
- Define your own foodchain and watch the population fight for food and shelter

- Communal animals can look out for each other, storing extra food and water inside of shelters for animals of the same species who are struggling.
- Throughout their lifecycle, once old enough, require a shelter to reproduce. An animal of the other gender needs to be in the shelter at the same time. Traits are passed down through this process, traits are selected from the parents and will be randomly modified to encourage "mutation". As the simulation progresses animal stats should improve. 
- Animals who find a shelter will remember the location, and head towards it when they have excess food / water or are starving / dehydrating. Over time, animals will forget this location, their memory will be refreshed when seeing the shelter once more.
- Population data can now be viewed via piechart
